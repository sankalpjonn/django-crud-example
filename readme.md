# A Django CRUD application for taking notes

This repo is a sample Django application which serves as a demonstration of how easy it is to build CRUD APIs using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)

To demonstrate CRUD, I built this note taking application that is meant to mimic the apple notes app that looks like this.

![notes app](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b0187743608fe07eecd0a/5fb0b9d425f3cd182e5e71e0_notesapp.png)

The capabilities of this application include
- Creating a new note with an empty title and content.
- Updating the newly created note with a title and content.
- Reading the fields of a note.
- Partially updating the note by modifying either tile or content.
- Listing all the notes in the database sorted by last updated timestamp.
- Deleting a note by marking it as deactivated.

You can find the [full tutorial in here](https://www.sankalpjonna.com/posts/building-a-django-crud-application-in-minutes). Feel free to use this repo as a boilerplate code for any Django application that you are building.

## Installation

Step 1: Setup virtual envrionment
```sh
# create virtual environment
python3 -m venv django_env
# activate virtual environment
source django_env/bin/activate
```

Step 2: Install requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements
```

Step 3: Run migrations
```sh
python manage.py migrate
```
Step 4: Run the server
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

## Usage

You can view the app here `http://localhost:8000/note`. This will display the interface generated by Django Rest Framework which you can use to perform all of the CRUD operations.

This interface is simply meant to demonstrate how a HTTP method on this URL will function and you can use this as a reference while integrating these APIs in your client application.
